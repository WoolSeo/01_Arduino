//Bricktronics Example: SingleMotor
//http://www.wayneandlayne.com/bricktronics
//This example uses a LEGO NXT Motor.

//This example starts the motor at an intermediate speed, then speeds it up to full speed, and does the same in reverse.

//This example uses a motor, so it needs more power than a USB port can give.  We really don't recommend running motors off of USB ports--they will be slow and sluggish, other things won't quite work right, things can get hot--it's just not a good idea.  Use an external power supply that provides between 9V and 7.2V, and can provide at least 600 mA per motor (1A preferably).  Two options that work really well are a 9V wall adapter (2.1mm plug, center positive) or a 6xAA battery pack.

//Connect a motor to Motor Port 1.

Bricktronics brick = Bricktronics();
Motor m = Motor(&brick, 1);

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(115200);
    Serial.println("Hello world.");
    brick.begin();
    m.begin();
}

void loop() 
{
    while (true)
    {
        Serial.println("Going forward.");
        m.set_speed(75);
        delay(1000);
        m.set_speed(255);
        delay(500);
        Serial.println("Going in reverse.");
        m.set_speed(-75);
        delay(1000);
        m.set_speed(-255);
        delay(500);
        
    }
}
